Perfect 👍 Thanks for clarifying. Let’s make the README even simpler so it matches exactly what you want:

# Carpool Application

The Carpool application helps users share rides within campuses or across cities by matching routes and schedules. Drivers can offer rides and passengers can find rides that fit their pickup/dropoff and time window. The app reduces cost, congestion, and carbon footprint while providing a simple, secure experience.

## Core Features

* **Authentication**

  * Sign up, log in, log out (JWT-based)
  * Profile view/update (name, email, university, address)

* **Rides (Driver)**

  * Offer a ride (pickup/dropoff with coordinates, seats, time, price, notes)
  * View “My Rides”
  * Update or delete your rides

* **Find a Ride (Passenger)**

  * Geo + time-window search (lng/lat with 2dsphere index)
  * Filter by radius, departure time window, and minimum seats
  * Real-time updates when new rides are posted (Socket.IO)

* **Bookings**

  * Request a booking (passenger → driver)
  * Driver accepts/rejects booking; seats adjust automatically
  * Live notifications for ride/booking updates (Socket.IO)

## Tech Stack

* **MongoDB** with 2dsphere indexes for geospatial queries
* **Express** REST API with JWT auth
* **React** (CRA) frontend with Tailwind CSS
* **Node.js** backend
* **Socket.IO** for real-time ride/booking updates

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

* `server.js`: Entry point for the Express server
* `config/db.js`: Database connection setup
* `controllers/`: Logic for authentication, booking, and rides
* `middleware/authMiddleware.js`: Handles authentication checks
* `models/`: Mongoose models for User, Ride, Booking
* `routes/`: API endpoints for auth, booking, and rides

### Frontend (React/Tailwind CSS)

* `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (Navbar, RideForm, RideList, etc.)
* `src/pages/`: Main pages (Login, Register, Profile, Rides, Search)
* `src/context/AuthContext.js`: Authentication context provider
* `src/axiosConfig.jsx`: Axios setup for API requests
* `public/`: Static assets and HTML template

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install all dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   Add your database URI and other secrets in `backend/config/db.js` or a `.env` file.

3. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This starts both backend and frontend at once.

## Usage

* Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Backend: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

✅ Now it’s simple: `npm run install-all` then `npm start`.

Do you also want me to include a **sample `.env` file** snippet in the README (with `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc.) so setup is quicker for others?
